# UFOs Analysis
  An in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on the UFO website created for Dana. using JavaScript we populated an HTML table with UFO sighting data and, created filter criterias to search through the table in order to find rows that match user input.



## Results
  We created a HTML webpage which housed the full dataset. The page contains a header and two sections. One section houses the search criterias and the other section houses the table. In the search criteria section, the user can input their required filter criterias the table will update automatically based on that input. In order to reset the table, the user can click the "UFO Sightings" link on the top left corner of the page.

# Conclusion
  Being able to search and gather data concerning UFO information. though operational, the script for app could be made a little more efficient to cut down run time. One drawback of the table is that the data gets filtered automatically right after the user inputs the data. It would have been better design if the "Filter Data" button was retained and used as the event listener. Then the data would only get filtered if the button was clicked by the user.

  We can make further improvements to the webpage by adding a "Reset Data" button. This is more intuitive than the user having to click the link on the top of the page to refersh the filters.
